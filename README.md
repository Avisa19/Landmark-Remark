# Landmark-Remark

Hi, 

Thank you for considering me for the software engineer (iOS) role at Tigerspike Company.

The time that I spent to finish Landmark Remark project was around 10 hours.

I do not use storyboard, I did all my project programmatically according how Apple Co. do the coding for creating an app with swift.

*******About my project scheme:

1-  Once when you launch the app, you will see sign up page , to enter your username and email and password. 

2-  After that user will login and main page will pop up which is Home page.

3-  I use TabBar to for three pages, one is Home Page, second is Search page , third is User page.

4-  In Home page you can see all users saved locations along with their username & short note & short Address and if you zoom in, you are able to see all users in same location and area.

5-  In Search page you are able to search according to username, at the time you type the username, it will find it for you, you can tap to username  cell and see their locations.

6-  In User page, At first you will see your current location which shown in the map with blue- Dot,  and in your current location or which location you wish to add note,
      first write your note in the box above then hold your finger on your location and
      it will save in the map.

              6-1- At the right top of User page there is a button you are able to logout, or cancel and continue using the app.

7-  My application perform well on an iPhone X and later form factor device. 

8-  I use Firebase Database for my server-side aspect.

9-  I added documentation markup and it will display in Quick Help.

               *** Source code will be developed and runnable in XCode 10 ***
